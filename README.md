A repository of past Partial Differential Equation projects. Intro to PDES projects 1-3 were completed in MATLAB in 2018 for the Imperial introduction to computational PDE's course.

### Intro to PDE's Project 1 2018
*  Implemented Centered Finite difference method on a linked diffusion system in polar coordinates.
*  Example contour graphs shown below for some fixed times.
