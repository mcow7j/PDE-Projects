A repository of past Partial Differential Equation projects. Intro to PDES projects 1-3 were completed in MATLAB in 2018 for the Imperial introduction to computational PDE's course.

### Intro to PDE's Project 1 2018
*  Implemented Centered Finite difference method on a linked diffusion system in polar coordinates.
*  Example contour graphs shown below for some fixed times.

### Intro to PDE's Project 2 2018
Project was  concerned with numerically solving equations of the form on a uniform rectangular grid:

*  Numerical Solutions for equation (1) were achieved by using a Centred Finite Difference Method along with Gauss Seidel and Multi-Grid method to improve convergence. 
*  Numerical Solutions for equation (10) were achieved by using a Centred Finite Difference and Crank Nicolson Method along with an altered Gauss Seidel and Multi-Grid methods to improve convergence.
*  Below is an example simulation with a known solution for error comparison.

### Intro to PDE's Project 3 2018
*  Implemented a Multigrid method on a L- shaped grid.
