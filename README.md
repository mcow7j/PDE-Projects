A repository of past Partial Differential Equation projects. Intro to PDES projects 1-3 were completed in MATLAB in 2018 for the Imperial introduction to computational PDE's course.

### Intro to PDE's Project 1 2018
*  Implemented Centered Finite difference method on a linked diffusion system in polar coordinates.
*  Example contour graphs shown below for some fixed times.

### Intro to PDE's Project 2 2018
Project was  concerned with numerically solving equations of the form on a uniform rectangular grid:

*  Achieved by using a Centred Finite Difference Method along with Gauss Seidel and Multi-Grid method to improve convergence. 
*  Below is a an example simulation with a known solution for error comparison. 



### Intro to PDE's Project 3 2018
*  Implemented a Multigrid method on a L- shaped grid.
